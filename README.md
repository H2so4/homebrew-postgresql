Homebrew PostgreSQL things
==========================

These formulae allow installing multiple versions of PostgreSQL in parallel.  This is similar to what you can do on certain Linux distributions, for example Debian.

Just `brew tap petere/postgresql` and then `brew install <formula>`.

More to come.
